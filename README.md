# Weight-Converter

This weight converter project converts pounds to kilograms. The webpage features an input field where users can enter weight in pounds, and the webpage automatically displays the equivalent weight in kilograms. After 10 seconds, the result is removed, and the input field is emptied using the 'set time out' method. I have also incorporated an error-handling feature to handle negative input numbers. If the user enters a negative number, the webpage displays an error message, "Please enter a valid number. In this project, I learned how to handle error situations and remove the error message after two seconds using an event listener for the input field. The event listener calls a function that performs the desired actions. Codes are availavle in the master branch.
